1. Add your code to the appropriate branch! We will be using github to collaborate on all of our code, so now's the time to get to know it! Only add to the in-progress 
branch for now.
2. General Github etiquette:
  Just because you can doesn't mean you should... please make sure all of your contributions are meaningful and productive
  Don't update broken code to a shared branch-- that messes with everyone who's trying to work on that branch
  Don't edit code directly on github please. You can't test it that way and it probably won't work the first time-- see above
  WORK TOGETHER-- if you make changes without telling anyone, their stuff will probably break and then we'll all be sad
  Don't pull request or merge branches without talking to me(Jonathan) first
  Thats all for now, but I might add to this list if things come up. Thanks!
